        "An NFT stands for \"Non-fungible token\" and is a fancy way of saying it's a unique, one of a kind digital item that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFTs main purpose is to be digital art. However, some like Gray Boys offer additional utility like exclusive access to a DAO, member only content, access to events & community, and more. Think of Gray Boys like a rare piece of digital art that also acts as a \"members\" card.",
        "Metamask is a crypto wallet that can store your Ethereum and is needed to purchase and mint a Gray Boy. Having a wallet gives you an Ethereum address (i.e. 0xABCD....1234), this is where your Gray Boy NFT will be stored. You can get Metamask and learn more here: ",
        "A DAO stands for \"Decentralized Autonomous Organization\". It's an organization controlled by its members and governed by rules written into a smart contract on the blockchain. The Mothership DAO is controlled by its members and used to purchase metaverse NFTs through voting done by members. The DAO grants proxied ownership of The Mothership's acquired NFTs to its members, and more. It does not provide liquidity benefits and therefore is not at risk of being considered a security.",
