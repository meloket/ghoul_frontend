        `The initial Gray Boys mint! The Mothership Engineers flip the on switch in the Mothership and welcome the 10,000 Gray Boys aboard, ready to conquer the metaverse.`,
        `Table stakes but worth mentioning nonetheless. The Mothership Engineers sent alien delegates that bartered with the Rarity.tools team to have Gray Boys listed.`,
        `The Gray Boys assemble in The Mothership’s grand hall and with the help of The Mothership’s Engineers, create The Mothership’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Mothership Engineers securely transport over 200 Eth of The Mothership’s funds into the DAO for the collective to use to start conquering metaverse NFTs and thus acquiring them through the DAO. \n \n
        All Gray Boys holders become members of the DAO and can submit proposals for what metaverse NFTs The Mothership conquers and acquires next for the DAO. Additionally, members can submit proposals for when the DAO should liquidate existing holdings to bolster the available DAO liquidity, and more. \n \n
        The Proxied Ownership system is then released to all members. Members are able to use DAO NFTs for verification, perk access, utility and more as if they were their own. Our proxied ownership system prevents transfers or any transactions against the shared hybrid watch-only member wallet. Private keys are never shared.
        `,
        `The Mothership Engineers open up the gaming section of The Mothership. \n \n
        Gray Boys will be playable within the massively multiplayer metaverse as exclusive, limited characters! We’re also working towards partnerships with The Sandbox and other metaverse games to make Gray Boys playable across multiple platforms.
        `,
        `The Mothership Engineers open up the research lab to all the Gray Boys. Here they can perform experiments on creatures, resources and more that The Mothership has conquered and acquired across the metaverse. \n\n
        The research lab will open up the ability for Gray Boys to perform science experiments, create hybrid creatures, and much more.
        `,
        `Gray Boys are airdropped and earn Mothership Tickets (token). Mothership tickets can be used in The Mothership’s Research Lab to perform special science experiments, as well as be used in many other places around the mothership. Further details to be announced soon!`,
        `Gray Boys holders will receive a top secret airdrop.`,
        `The DAO members assemble to create & start roadmap 2.0!`
